The only two known calves that it could be are 1810's or 1814's. Genetically- it cannot be 1810's calf. We thought 1814 lost her calf due to sightings of her alone on Jeffreys, but it could just have been a precocious calf. This whale's haplotype and genotype are consistent with it being 1814's calf- so it is likely that 1814 indeed did not lose her calf. It was unclear whether 3790 was a calf in 2007. An analysis by PKH, ARK, HMP, and MX on 9/19/13 determined that it was and calf alone was added to the behavior of both sightings.  Rationale: 1) Has overall calf “fatness” look. Calves in their first year have a very sausage like appearance and this whale did in BOF 2007, 2) Image d70s_0183 on 9/10/2007 It looks to me like the mandibular callosities are in the process of erupting, suggesting calf, 3) Evidence of milk mustache in 9/10/2007 d70s_0186, 4) Behaves like a calf - curious, breaching, rolling, charging about, 5) Other calves just as big or bigger- 3923 and the 2009CalfOf1817, 6) 1814 may not actually be alone in all sightings- the 8/30 sighting lasted only 2 minutes, and 7) Field observers thought it was a calf in both sightings.
